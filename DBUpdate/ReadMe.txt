Project Finished.

The project works in 6 steps. As given in the program, it uses a geographic area to narrow down the list of possible weather stations. It then takes a user input to select which weather station to featch parameters from. Finally, it lists which data is possible to download from the given weather station and requires a user input to select and download the data. It then stores this data in a PostgreSQL database for further prossesing and storage.
